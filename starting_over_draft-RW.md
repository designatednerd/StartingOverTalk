#Starting Over

We've all have times in our lives were we wonder in frustration, "How in the heck did I wind up here?"

Maybe you're working a job that drives you bananas, or a living in a city or with a person that just isn't the right fit, or maybe the industry you started out in is turning into a burnt-out husk of its former self.

Whatever the situation, we've all had times where we're in this place we're not happy with, and we realize we've got to switch to something new, no matter what the cost - we've got to start over.

I'm not talking about the situations where your boss transfers you to another city, your significant other dumps you, or any other situation beyond your control - I'm talking about situations where you drive the thought process. The situations where you decide that it's time to start over.

Just the mere mention of starting over makes some people cringe. And I don't blame them.

This is because starting over voluntarily is terrifying.

If you're starting over professionally, you go from being someone with lots of experience in your field to someone with *zero* experience in your field.

If you're starting over personally, you can wind up in a city, a state, or even a country where you don't know anyone.

I'm here today to tell you that often the things that make you fear starting over are myths - are traps! If you let yourself be paralyzed by these fears, you can miss out on a whole new chapter in life that you never would have experienced otherwise.

Starting over is scary - but it's not as scary as you think.

#My Story

I want to start by telling you my story. I've gone through three major phases in my life, all of them pretty different from the previous one: I was a songwriter, I worked in Television Production, and now I'm an iOS Engineer.

Each time I switched from phase to phase, it was a massive change, and extremely scary. But I learned a lot about the process. Before I get in to what I learned I want to share with you my story - a story I call "Ellen's Three Careers."

>RW: Feel free to rename the story but it would be fun to give it an interesting title like that.

###Songwriter

My first career was as a songwriter. It all started when I was ten years old, and got my first guitar. I started writing songs when I was twelve, and by the time I was eighteen, I had a couple regular gigs here in my hometown of DC.

All I wanted was to be the next Sheryl Crow, or the next Melissa Etheridge. And I poured tons of energy into songwriting.

I took all the money I'd gotten at my bat mitzvah and combined it with a couple years' worth of allowance, and I put out just before my 18th birthday.

You can still listen to it on Rdio or Spotify - it's called Bridge Over Bottled Water. I will warn you that my lyrics contain a heaping helping of teenage angst, because, well, I was a teenager.

Even after I went to college in Chicago, I spent an enormous amount of my free time playing and writing.

I started to pull together a little bit of success. I got my first showcase at a big music conference, and I started to book some bigger gigs in Chicago.

But as I started to pour myself into the work it took to become a successful working musician, I realized: This is going to make me absolutely hate music.

The musicians I often played with were great, but so many of the people that I dealt with around the music business were, to put it very mildly, colossal assholes.

They treated everyone around them like dirt at best, and the toxic attitude they projected seemed to get exponentially worse as you got even incrementally more successful.

You had to really, really, really love music to keep loving it after coming into contact with these people. I finally realized: Doing this professionally is not for me.

>RW: Please write a paragraph here about how this was scary, to reinforce your theme above. My attempt is below totally made up, please replace this w/ your own version.

This was an incredibly scary realization for me. My entire future life that I had planned out before me disappeared in an instant. My very identity was based around being a songwriter. My friends were musicians and songwriters - would they think of me as just another person who couldn't take it and bit the dust? What was I going to do now?

I won't lie, I may have written a song or two about all the angst I was feeling during this time. But after I was done moping, all I could do is move ahead - into career #2.

###TV Nerd

My second career was as a TV nerd. This all started because my parents had been generous enough to pay for my education on the condition that I study something other than music. 

Not wanting to miss out on a free education, I took a look at the options and decided to go to fillm school. I thought this would be a great way to learn about audio engineering, and pick up some practical, creative skills that easily transferred back to music.

But even though I decided a career in music wasn't going to be for me, I found that I was really enjoying working with sound in a more filmic fashion.

I was the sound recordist during shooting or the post-production sound editor on several films that my friends directed. I had a lot of fun, and I learned a lot about how to make things sound really great.

In September of 2003, I moved out to Los Angeles to try and break into the business. After purely audio-based internships didn't work out, I started applying for internships at anything that looked remotely interesting. I got a bite from a new talk show that had only been on the air for six weeks.

I wound up working for the Ellen DeGeneres show for almost two years, and I loved it. I worked at House for two years, on a show called Trust Me for 6 months...and then I worked a large number of failed pilots, or first episodes of shows that never actually became shows.

The failed pilots were the hardest. As a crew, we would all work ourselves into the ground trying to help make something good, and then *poof* - it was like all that work had disappeared into thin air.

No one would ever see what we made. If you've ever had a client pull the plug a good ways into a project, you know exactly how this feels.

I finally got so frustrated with this that I realized that I had completely lost my passion for what I was doing. 

>RW: Again, need a paragraph here to reinoforce the scary theme. again pls replace this paragraph with your own.

Once again, I realized I needed to start over. And if I though it had been scary last time, it was way worse this time. All of my skills were based in TV production - how was I going to get a job anywhere else? How was I going to pay my bills - I had an apartment and cat to take care of! And I have to admit, I had grown to appreciate the feeling of being an expert in my field - now I'd have to become a total n00b.

But again - after moping for a bit, there was no choice but to move forward - into career #3.

###Actual Nerd

My third career was as an actual nerd. I'd always been good at tech stuff, at least in comparison to the rest of the entertainment business: When I first started at Ellen, I was the only person who knew how to hook up a Mac to a networked printer.

As I moved from show to show, people started to figure out that I was often a reasonable substitute for calling IT. I was good enough at IT stuff that I put together a decent side business fixing computer and networking issues for writers, producers, and other people with more money than time.

I knew I could easily go into IT professionally. But I wanted something more challenging. I realized I didn't want to be fixing other people's mistakes: I wanted to be making my own.

And I was so fascinated by smartphones and their inherent potential that I knew, I just *knew* I had to learn how they worked.

I found a program at UCLA extension that quickly taught me the basics of Object-Oriented programming, and showed me how to make very rudimentary iPhone and Android apps. And that confirmed to me: This is what I want to do.

I kept building stuff. I made three iOS apps and two Android apps on my own. It was hard, especially back in the dark ages of 2011. I found RayWenderlich.com, and I inhaled tutorials from the site like air.

I even got a job and moved back to Chicago. I kept learning. I worked every spare second I had to keep getting better, and I continue to do that every single day.

Four years after I first learned how to program, I'm speaking about how to do it, and I'm building tools and tutorials to make it easier for other people.

#What did I learn? How can you use it?

So now that you've heard what is essentially my entire life story, involving two gigantic and scary cases of starting over from zero - I'd like to share with you five lessons I learned about the process of starting over.

###First, the thing that you're passionate about can change - and that's OK.

You always hear all sorts of advice about following your passion. And this is really easy if the thing you are passionate about is easy to get into, and pays a zillion dollars.

But it's a lot harder if thing you're passionate about is difficult, if it puts a mental or financial strain on you, or if you are working against any kind of entrenched system that tells you that you, for whatever reason, your work is not good enough.

And the fact of the matter is the thing that you were passionate about at 10, the thing that you're passionate about at 22, the thing you're passionate about at 40, and the thing you're passionate about at 65 can be different.

If you are doing something because you are passionate - not just because you want to make a buck - you have to constantly challenge that passion. You have to ask yourself the hard question: "Is this still what I want to do with my life?" Remember, we all only have a limited amount of time - especially if you only count the years that we're healthy.

Failing to ask this question of "Is this still what I want to do with my life?", and ask it regularly, can lead to years of dissatisfaction, because you're although doing what you once dreamed of doing, you don't realize that the dream belonged to a different version of you.

Your answer to "Is this still what I want to do with my life?" can remain yes for a long time. Simply asking this question is an incredibly helpful way to keep pushing yourself to work on the things that you are most passionate about and make the most of your life.

But you also have to be okay with the answer to that question being "No". You have to be willing to use that response as a jumping-off point to figure out, "Well, what *do* I want to do with my life?"

###Second, Making lemonade out of lemons is a necessity.

When you get to the point where you realize that you're not doing what you want to be doing with your life, you can feel like life handed you a lemon.

[picture of me with giant lemon]
In my case, this happened both literally and figuratively - Here's a picture of a lemon that almost hit me in the head when I was walking home from the gym one day.

Anytime you have a setback, it sucks. It's frustrating. It's like almost getting hit in the head with a gigantic lemon.

You have to be able to look at a setback, and while acknowledging that it sucked, focus on the, "Yeah it sucks, but I can't change the past. What I can change is what I do now."

If you spend all your time staring at the lemon that hit you, lamenting how heavy or how sour it is, thinking about how much better it would be if it were an orange, you're not able to look at the opportunities the lemon itself provides.

But if you say, OK, I've got this gigantic lemon, what on earth am I going to do with this? Well, sometimes you can wind up with a lot of delicious lemonade.

[pic of tons of lemonade]
In the literal case, one giant lemon can make more than half a gallon of lemonade.

In the figurative case, I'd originally intended to go get a Masters in Computer Science. But I quickly realized that I was not academically qualified to do this, and to get academically qualified was going to take me years, if it could be done at all. After I realized this, I was crushed for a while and sat around moping and staring at my figurative lemon.

But then I said no, I'm going to find a way. I looked around, and found the more professionally targeted UCLA Extension program.  I realized, well, I have this lemon of not being able to get a Masters in Computer science. But I have this other opportunity that could let me be a working software engineer significantly faster.

And the figurative lemonade? It's been my entire iOS career.

###Third, Change Is Not An Admission Of Failure.

This one may not apply to everyone, but for those who it does apply to, it's a huge one.

I was raised to be terrified of failure. I was a go-getter, a grade-grubber, a goody-two-shoes, and about 40 other synonyms for total nerd.

A B grade in school meant I was slacking. The couple times I got a C, it was as if the world had fallen apart, broken until that got pushed back up to at least an A-.

I'd always been raised with the idea that if I tried hard enough, I could make anything happen.

Part of why I was so terrified of starting over was the implicit acknowledgement that what I had been trying before just wasn't working, no matter how hard I'd tried. I thought it was admitting that I had failed.

It took the benefit of hindsight to realize that it wasn't an admission of failure: It was an admission that what I had been trying before wasn't for me.

When I released myself from the expectation that I had to succeed at every single thing I tried, starting over on a different thing became far, far easier.

###Fourth, You never never know what knowledge transfers.

When I worked in the TV industry, I had to deal with a lot of...big personalities. People who wanted things the way they wanted things, and wanted them that way *yesterday*.

From working with these people, I learned the absolutely critical nature of expectation-setting.

For the demanding people I worked for, if you told them something was going to happen to make them happy, and then it did not happen, they were *furious*.

But if you told them the incremental steps that were going to happen, and didn't overcommit, they were always happy - they were informed about what was happening, and they could see visible progress.

I haven't dealt with anyone nearly as nuts in tech as some folks I dealt with in the entertainment industry. But anyone who's done client work is probably nodding along in agreement right now.

That technique I learned to cope with working for total looney tunes proved highly, highly useful in simply dealing with businesses who need to make decisions based on the schedule you give them. That's something I never would have expected I'd learn from working in the entertainment industry, and similarly you will find skills transfer from different phases in your life in very unexcted ways.

Fifth and finally, this leads into the most important thing I learned:

###You can learn anything - as long as you know how to learn.

One of the things that always terrified me about starting over was the idea that I would be "throwing away" everything that I'd learned about the thing I'd been previously pursuing.

I mean, how would the knowledge of how to tune a guitar apply to ordering film? How would the knowledge of how to find a 30' Technocrane a day before you were supposed to shoot apply to building a drop-in UIPopoverController replacement?

But what I realized was that in all of my attepmted careers, I'd learned how to research things. I learned how to word Google searches precisely enough that I could get it to give me back *exactly* what I was looking for, whether it was how to play a song on the guitar, how to install a firmware update for a particular windows machine, or the exact wording of a super long UIGestureRecognizerDelegate method.

When I started programming, I was already miles and miles ahead of other people in my classes because I could coax useful information out of the Apple and Android docs, StackOverflow, and other online resources far more efficiently.

This has become newly clear with Swift. I've had to start over yet again - to come from a very traditionally object-oriented language to a more functional one, like many of you in this room. And learning an entire new syntax, one that requires me to tie my pinky to my ring finger to keep from typing semicolons, has been hard.

But I know that because I've learned how to *learn*, and not just how to do one specific thing, I can do it. And I will do it. And I am so, so excited to do it.

Those are the five lessons I've learned over a lifetime of starting over. The things you are passionate about can change, making lemons out of lemonade is a necessity, change is not an admisison of failure, you never know what knowledge transfers, and you can learn anything - as long as you know how to learn.

So next time you wonder "How in the heck did I end up here?" and you make that tough decision that it's time to start over, I hope you embrace these lessons I've shared today.

Because once you do, you'll realize:

#Starting over is terrifying.

#But it's also the most exciting thing in the world.
